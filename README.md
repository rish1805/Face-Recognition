# Face-Recognition
Check out my Face Recognition computer vision software!

Key Features:
- Face Detection : Uses OpenCV’s Haar Cascade to identify faces in images.
- Face Comparison – Implements MSE to measure the similarity between detected faces and known faces.
- Multiple Face Recognition : Supports recognizing multiple individuals from a pre-loaded database.
- Real-time Visualization: Highlights detected faces and displays their matched identities.

Tech stack used was python, OpenCV, NumPy and Matplotlib.
